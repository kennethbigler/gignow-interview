This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project also has installed [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/).

## Prepare for your coding Challenge

This is the coding challenge for GigNow, a subsidiary of Ernst & Young.

### Design

Click on `design.png`. This is what the final product should look like.

### Data

Click on `src > data.js`. This is what the data passed to the frontend looks like.
You will need to make this data look just like the design above.
Note that you will get this data from props.

### Notes

1. In the end we should see 4 activity logs
2. They should be ordered with the most recent event on top
3. Viewing the same job req 2x should be ignored
4. Viewing a job req on different days should be separated into 2 events
5. On click of a job req should call the callback function passed in through props
6. Nice to have - can we show the date only 1x? see design
7. If you have time - move activity logs to state, and add a "Delete" functionality
